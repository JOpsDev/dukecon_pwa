## Offline Functionality

This application is a PWA (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app[Progressive Web App]).

All static web resources will be pre-loaded by the service worker.
All calls to the _/rest_ URLs will be cached and service with the previously downloaded version if the app is offline.
From a developer's point of view you should be able to develop the application in offline mode and it will 'just work' in offline mode.

Offline functionality is not available in development mode.
It is only available in production mode (that is: when you run _npm run build_).

To test the offline functionality you will usually deploy it to a server and you'll need the REST resources to be available in a relative path.

To test it locally there is a switch in Conference.js to run it locally for the JavaLand conference:

----
npm run build
npm install -g serve
serve dist
----
