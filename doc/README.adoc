## Offline Functionality

This application is a PWA (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app[Progressive Web App]).

Offline functionality is not available in development mode.
It is only available in production mode (that is: when you run _npm run build_).

To test the offline functionality you will usually deploy it to a server and you'll need the REST resources to be available in a relative path.

To test it locally there is a switch in Conference.js to run it locally for the JavaLand conference:

----
npm run build
npm install -g serve
serve dist
----
